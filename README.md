# 🧵 Textile Supplier Risk Analysis using NLP & Machine Learning

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to identify and classify risks from news articles related to global textile dye suppliers.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Textile companies often depend on a small number of critical dye suppliers. Disruptions due to geopolitical, environmental, or financial issues can severely impact operations. This project aims to:
- Proactively identify supply chain risks
- Classify them into risk categories using NLP and machine learning
- Support data-driven decisions for risk mitigation
